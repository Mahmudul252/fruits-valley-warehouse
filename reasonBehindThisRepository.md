I have commited 25 changes to the private repository. Then after changing something in my project, I tried to commit and then during git operation my pc has suddenly turned off due to load shedding (I have no battery in my laptop. I usually run my laptop with charger). After appearing electricity, I tried to commit again and the following error occured. I tried to fixed it with the help of google but failed. So I created this repo.
